A small script to help updating python3 packages on the openSUSE
build server:

https://build.opensuse.org/project/show/devel:languages:python3

Could also be used for python2.7 with some tiny modifications.

* Files
** dlp3.py

Check for updated version on pypi, print a list of packages that need
updates together with the a link where the changelog information can be found.
Also manage the json file that stores the changelog information

Check the build status of several packages at the same time. Automate
submission to dlp3 for package that build correctly. Also produce
cleanup commands for packages that got accepted and therefore are not
on OBS, but still on the local computer.

** package-changelog-data.json

The file that stores the links to the changelog files. If there is no
changelog available, but a git repository exist the command to clone
the git repo should be stored.

** dlp3.conf

A simple config file that stores the path information. You can also
define a list of packages that should be skipped during update checks.

* Workflow
  My standard workflow is to:
  1) run dlp3.py
  3) run update <list of packages>
  4) go into a newly created branch
     - check osc status
     - call osc vc, add changelog. Use link
       provided by dlp3 or find changelog
       and add link via 'addlog'
     - edit spec file if needed
  5) 'add <package>' to start monitoring its progress (does 'osc ci -n')
  6) repeat step 4 and 5
  7) run 'status'
  8) when enough packages finished building successfully, run
     'submit', go to the webpage and accept requests (currently not automated
     since I like to check the diff over there) and then 'cleanup'

* Installation

Adjust the config file, so that it has the correct path information.

Just use the files directly from the git-repo or create links into for
example your ~/bin directory. In this case you should also link the
config file to ~/.config/dlp3/

* TO-DO
  - The program could check every 5 seconds automatically
  - open changelogs automatically in your browser
